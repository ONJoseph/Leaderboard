## Description

In this activity I will set up a JavaScript project for the Leaderboard list app, using webpack and ES6 features, notably modules. I should develop a first working version of the app following a wire frame, but without styling - just focus on functionality. In following activities, I will consume the Leaderboard API using JavaScript async and await and add some styling.

## Instructions:

### Phase 1, setup project

- [x] Use [Gitflow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/gitflow.md)
- [x] Create an npm project with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/output-management/#setting-up-htmlwebpackplugin)
- [x] Write plain HTML markup with minimum styling (just to make the layout), because you will implement styles in the following steps
- [x] Don't make API calls (you'll do it in a following lesson).
- [x] Use ES6 modules, with import and export.

### Phase 2, hit the API

- [x] Read the Leader board API documentation to learn how to use this API.
- [x] Create a new game with the name of your choice by using the API.
- [x] Implement the "Refresh" button (receiving data from the API and parsing the JSON).
- [x] Implement the form "Submit" button (sending data to the API).
- [x] Use `async` and `await` JavaScript features to consume the API.
- [x] No styling is required.

### Phase 3, final touches

- At this point I should have a fully working app that uses only basic styles to make the layout work, according to this wire frame shown above.
- Now you should improve the look and feel of the application, adding the styles of your choice.
- Please keep the general layout of the wire frame, this is the only mandatory requirement.
- You can use plain CSS or any CSS framework, it's up to you.
